# MCT0144C6W_128X128_Colour_Display-
C File for 128x128 Colour Display
This C file contains all the necessary functions to initialise the Midas MCT0144C6W128128PML colour display.
It has a custom function to write numbers as demonstrated on YouTube.
No writing numbers and blanking, this function written by me, John B, writes any number up to 100'000000 and blanks an empty position only if it has been used.
No libraries required except for a ‘long to string’ function in your own IDE.
Feel free to donate a coffee for all the effort creating the custom routines. The link is in the 'show more' of the video on YouTube.
I try my best for you not to have to use or include any other library.
