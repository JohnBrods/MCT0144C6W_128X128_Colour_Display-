# MCT0144C6W_128X128_Colour_Display-
C File for 128x128 Colour Display
This C file contains all the necessary functions to initialise the Midas MCT0144C6W display and write numbers to it as demonstrated on YouTube.
No libraries required except for a ‘long to string’ function in your own IDE.
The ‘write number’ function was developed by me, John B.
I now have custom routines for the ILI9341 and SSD1963 Displays too.
Feel free to donate a coffee for all the effort creating the custom routines. The link is in the 'show more' of the video on YouTube.
I try my best for you not to have to use or include any other library.

Thank You John B 03/06/2021.
